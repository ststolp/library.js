    <h1>Choose Your Own Adventure</h1>
    This project I did outside of class. The logic for the game comes from 
    a json file that holds an array of objects which hold properties
    that tell the javascript where to go next in the story. The app stays
    on the same page so that the back button can't take you back to the previous
    "page" of the story.
